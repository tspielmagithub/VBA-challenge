VBA-challenge Week 2 homework
In this second homework I searched for summary of stock tickers, changes in yearly prices, percentage of changes, and total stock's values. I ceated a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the required information. The script aslo loops for every worksheet (every yeear 2018-2020). I also used conditional formatting for one of the columns that highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.
Here are the detailed instructions for the above explained homework. Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs : 1) the ticker symbol; 2)yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year; 3) The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year; 4) The total stock volume of the stock. Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once. NOTE: Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red. All three of the following are uploaded to GitHub/GitLab: a) screenshots of the results; b) separate VBA script files; c) README file
